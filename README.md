# OLR-Seasonal-Hysteresis
This is a repo for my MSci thesis project

The Jupyter notebooks are for recreating the key figures.

Cluster code is provided for recreation of the simulation data. These scripts require the Slurm workload manager.

The netcdf files in the data folder are derived from [long term monthly mean NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.derived.html). These files have been cast onto a 2.5 x 2.5 degree grid, so that this does not need to be performed at the start of each individual notebook.
